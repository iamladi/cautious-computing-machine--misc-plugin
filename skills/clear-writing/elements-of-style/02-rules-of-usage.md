# Elementary Rules of Usage

Grammar and punctuation fundamentals from Strunk's Elements of Style.

## Rule 1: Possessive Singular Formation

Add **'s** to form possessive singular nouns regardless of final consonant.

**Examples:**
- Charles's friend
- Burns's poems
- the witch's malice

**Exceptions:**
- Ancient proper names ending in -es/-is: Moses' laws, Isis' temple
- Jesus'
- Phrases: for conscience' sake, for righteousness' sake
- Pronominal possessives have no apostrophe: hers, its, theirs, yours, oneself

## Rule 2: Serial Comma

In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.

**Examples:**
- red, white, and blue
- gold, silver, or copper
- He opened the letter, read it, and threw it away.

**Exception:** Business firm names often omit the final comma: Brown, Shipley & Co.

## Rule 3: Parenthetic Expressions

Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas. Never insert only one comma when two are required.

**Always parenthetic:**
- Dates: "February 3, 1987, was the date"
- Abbreviations: etc., jr.
- Non-restrictive relative clauses (which supplement rather than identify)

**Not parenthetic:**
- Restrictive clauses (which identify the antecedent)

**Examples:**
| Restrictive (no commas) | Non-restrictive (commas) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| "People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" | "My brother, who lives in Boston, is a doctor" |
| The clause identifies which people | The clause merely adds information |

## Rule 4: Comma Before Conjunction in Coordinate Clauses

Place a comma before a conjunction introducing a coordinate clause.

**Examples:**
- "The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape."
- "I have heard the rumors, but I don't believe them."

**Use semicolon when adverb replaces conjunction:**
- "The situation is perilous; therefore, we must act."

**No comma when:**
- Subjects are identical and expressed once, with *and*: "He read the letter and put it away."
- A dependent clause precedes the second independent clause

## Rule 5: Don't Join Independent Clauses with Comma Alone

Use semicolon for compound sentences from grammatically complete, unconjoined clauses.

**Wrong:** "Stevenson's romances are entertaining, they are full of exciting adventures."

**Right:**
- "Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures."
- "Stevenson's romances are entertaining. They are full of exciting adventures."
- "Stevenson's romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting adventures."

**Semicolon indicates relationship** (usually cause or consequence) more forcefully than other punctuation.

**Exception:** Very short, similarly structured clauses may take commas: "Man proposes, God disposes."

## Rule 6: Don't Break Sentences in Two

Avoid using periods for commas. Fragments should attach to the preceding sentence.

**Wrong:**
```
He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the world.
```

**Right:**
```
He was an interesting talker, a man who had traveled all over the world.
```

**Exception:** Emphatic single words or expressions may stand alone if emphasis is genuine and unambiguous.

## Rule 7: Participial Phrases Must Refer to Grammatical Subject

A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.

**Wrong:**
- "Walking slowly down the road, the mountain came into view."
- (The mountain isn't walking)

**Right:**
- "Walking slowly down the road, we saw the mountain come into view."

**This applies to:**
- Participial phrases with conjunctions or prepositions
- Appositive nouns
- Adjectives and adjective phrases beginning sentences

**Test:** Ask "Who is doing the action in the opening phrase?" The answer must be the subject of the main clause.
