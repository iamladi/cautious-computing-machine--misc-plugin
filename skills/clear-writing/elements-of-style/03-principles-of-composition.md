# Elementary Principles of Composition

Structure and voice fundamentals from Strunk's Elements of Style.

## Rule 8: One Topic Per Paragraph

Each paragraph should organize around a single topic. A new paragraph signals a new step in the development of the subject.

**For short compositions:**
- Treat each sentence as a paragraph
- Serve as transitions between introduction, development, and conclusion

**For longer compositions:**
- Topic sentence opens the paragraph
- Supporting sentences develop the topic
- Concluding sentence summarizes or transitions

## Rule 9: Open With Topic Sentence, End in Alignment

Let readers grasp each paragraph's purpose immediately.

**Topic sentence functions:**
- Announces subject to be dealt with
- Helps reader skip if already familiar
- Aids memory and review

**Ending requirement:**
- Final sentence should align with opening
- Complete the thought, don't introduce new topics

## Rule 10: Use Active Voice

The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive.

**Passive (weak):**
- "My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me."
- "The report was written by the team."
- "It was decided that we should proceed."

**Active (strong):**
- "I shall always remember my first visit to Boston."
- "The team wrote the report."
- "We decided to proceed."

**When passive is acceptable:**
- When the actor is unknown: "The cargo was stolen."
- When the receiver of action is the topic: "The body was found in the river."
- When you need a particular word as subject for emphasis

**Warning:** Avoid making one passive depend on another.

**Terrible:** "Gold combats were combatted for money prizes, which were offered for to."

## Rule 11: Put Statements in Positive Form

Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, non-committal language.

**Negative (weak):**
- He was not very often on time.
- She did not think studying Latin was useful.
- The Taming of the Shrew is not the only one of Shakespeare's comedies that has been made into a successful musical.

**Positive (strong):**
- He usually came late.
- She thought studying Latin was useless.
- The Taming of the Shrew has been made into a successful musical, along with several other Shakespeare comedies.

**Word substitutions:**
| Negative | Positive |
|----------|----------|
| did not remember | forgot |
| did not pay attention | ignored |
| did not have confidence in | distrusted |
| not important | trifling |
| not honest | dishonest |
| does not have | lacks |

**Note:** Use *not* deliberately for antithesis: "not charity, but simple justice"

## Rule 12: Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language

Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

**Vague:**
- "A period of unfavorable weather set in."
- "He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward."

**Specific:**
- "It rained every day for a week."
- "He grinned as he pocketed the coin."

**If those who write in this way would look into the matter, they would find:**
- "A period of unfavorable weather" = could mean drought, flood, fog, or cold
- "Definite" means knowing which one

**Rule:** The surest way to arouse reader interest is to be specific and definite.

## Rule 13: Omit Needless Words

A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.

**This doesn't mean short sentences only.** It means every word must tell.

**Wordy expressions:**
| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| the question as to whether | whether |
| there is no doubt but that | no doubt / doubtless |
| used for fuel purposes | used for fuel |
| he is a man who | he |
| in a hasty manner | hastily |
| this is a subject which | this subject |
| His story is a strange one. | His story is strange. |
| the reason why is that | because |

**"The fact that" violations:**
| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| owing to the fact that | since / because |
| in spite of the fact that | though / although |
| call your attention to the fact that | remind you / notify you |
| I was unaware of the fact that | I was unaware that / I did not know |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure |
| the fact that I had arrived | my arrival |

**"Who is" and "which was" are often expendable:**
- "His brother, who is a member of the firm" → "His brother, a member of the firm"
- "Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle" → "Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle"

## Rule 14: Avoid Succession of Loose Sentences

Especially those of two coordinate clauses where the second is introduced by a conjunction or relative.

**Monotonous pattern:**
```
The Tao Teh Ching is the most important book in Chinese literature, and it was
written by Lao Tzu in the sixth century B.C. It consists of eighty-one short
chapters, and these chapters are divided into two parts. The first part deals
with the nature of the Tao, and the second part deals with its manifestation.
```

**Varied structure:**
```
The most important book in Chinese literature, the Tao Teh Ching was written
by Lao Tzu in the sixth century B.C. Its eighty-one short chapters fall into
two parts: the first on the nature of the Tao, the second on its manifestation.
```

**Diagnose:** Read aloud. If every sentence follows the same rhythm, vary the structure.

## Rule 15: Express Coordinate Ideas in Parallel Form

Similar ideas should have similar form.

**Non-parallel:**
- "The French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese"
- "Formerly, science was taught by the lecture method; now it is taught through individual laboratory work."

**Parallel:**
- "The French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Portuguese"
- "Formerly, science was taught by the lecture method; now it is taught by the laboratory method."

**Correlatives (both...and, not only...but also, either...or, first...second) should be followed by the same grammatical construction:**

**Wrong:** "It was both a long meeting and very tedious."

**Right:** "The meeting was both long and tedious."

## Rule 16: Keep Related Words Together

The position of words shows their relationship. Readers shouldn't have to decode sentence structure.

**Subject and verb:** Avoid interposing lengthy phrases.

**Awkward:** "The dog, despite the fact that it was tired and had traveled a long way that day on rough roads, ran joyfully to meet its master."

**Better:** "Despite the fact that it was tired and had traveled a long way that day on rough roads, the dog ran joyfully to meet its master."

**Relative pronoun:** Should come immediately after its antecedent.

**Ambiguous:** "There was a stir in the audience that suggested impatience."

**Clear:** "A stir suggesting impatience rippled through the audience."

**Modifiers:** Place adjacent to words they modify.

**Wrong:** "He only found two errors." (implies he should have done something else with them)

**Right:** "He found only two errors."

## Rule 17: Use Consistent Tense in Summaries

**For fiction:** Present tense throughout for dramatic effect.

"In Hamlet, the weights are unequal. Claudius is a criminal, and it is Shakespeare's intention that we should feel no sympathy for him."

**For history/journalism:** Past tense is natural.

**Avoid:** Switching tenses within a summary. Pick one and stick with it.

**Avoid:** Constant attribution ("he said," "she replied") in literary summaries. Establish once, then proceed as if reporting.

## Rule 18: Place Emphatic Words at Sentence End

The position of emphasis is the end. The secondary position is the beginning.

**Weak ending:**
- "Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways."
- "Four centuries ago, Christopher Colombo sought the New World, a vast, unknown continent."

**Strong ending:**
- "Since that time, humanity has advanced in many ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude."
- "Four centuries ago, Christopher Colombo sought a vast, unknown continent—the New World."

**The principle applies to words, sentences, and paragraphs.**

The end is the position of climax. Don't bury your best material in the middle.
