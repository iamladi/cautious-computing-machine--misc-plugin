# A Few Matters of Form

Formatting conventions from Strunk's Elements of Style.

## Headings

Leave a blank line after titles or headings. On subsequent pages, start on the first line.

## Numerals

Use figures or Roman notation for dates and serial numbers rather than spelling them out.

**Examples:**
- August 9, 1918 (or 9 August 1918)
- Rule 3
- Chapter XII
- 352nd Infantry

**Spell out:**
- Numbers at the beginning of sentences
- Round numbers that can be expressed in one or two words

## Parentheses

Sentences containing parenthetical expressions follow standard punctuation outside the marks, as if the parenthetical content weren't present.

**Examples:**
- "I went to his house yesterday (my third attempt to see him), but he had left town."
- "He declares (and why should we doubt his good faith?) that he is now certain of success."

**Interior punctuation:** Treat the expression as independent, except omit the final period unless it's a question mark or exclamation point.

**Fully detached parenthesized sentences:** Place the final stop before the closing mark. (This is an example.)

## Quotations

**Formal quotations:** Introduce with colons and enclose in quotation marks.
```
The provision of the Constitution is: "No tax or duty shall be laid on articles
exported from any State."
```

**Quotations in apposition or as direct objects:** Precede with commas.
```
He said, "I'll be there by noon."
```

**Verse quotations:** Full-line or longer quotations begin on fresh lines, centered, without quotation marks required.

**Indirect discourse:** Omit quotation marks when introduced by "that."
```
He said that he would be there by noon.
```

**No quotation marks needed for:**
- Proverbs
- Familiar literary phrases
- Colloquialisms
- Slang (when appropriate)

## References

**In scholarly work:**
- Abbreviate frequently-used titles
- Provide full forms in an alphabetical list
- Present references in parentheses or footnotes, not within sentences

**Omit words like:**
- "act," "scene," "line," "book," "volume," "page"

Except when it's the only reference type used.

**Examples:**
- (Act II, scene iii, line 12) → (II, iii, 12)
- (Volume I, page 237) → (I, 237)

## Syllabication (Word Division)

When dividing words at line ends:

**Follow formation:**
- know-ledge (not knowl-edge)
- Shake-speare (not Shakes-peare)

**Follow vowel placement:**
- apol-ogy
- presi-dent

**Double letters:**
- refer-ring
- tell-ing

**Avoid:**
- Cutting single letters from words
- Cutting only two letters from long words
